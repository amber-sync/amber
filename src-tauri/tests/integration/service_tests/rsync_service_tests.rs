//! RsyncService integration tests
//!
//! Note: Most RsyncService tests are unit tests in the service file itself
//! (src/services/rsync_service.rs) because they test argument building logic
//! without needing actual rsync execution.
//!
//! E2E tests that run real rsync are in tests/e2e/rsync_tests.rs
